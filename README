WymEditorHelper
===============
Makes it easy to incorporate WYMeditor into your views.

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to use:

	* From your project's root, run:
		ruby script/plugin install svn://zuurstof.openminds.be/home/kaizer/svn/wym_editor_helper
		rake wym:install
	* Put <%= wym_editor_initialize %> in the view that will host the text editing form.
	Prefereably this goes into your html's HEAD, to keep our html W3C valid. 
	I use <%= wym_editor_initialize unless !%w(new create edit).include?(@controller.action_name) -%> in my layout. 
	This means the editor will only load when someone is creating or editing something.
	* create a database, and a model with ie. a content column.
	* in the form, instead of i.e. <%= text_area :article, :content %>, use <%= wym_editor :article, :content %>
	OR add a 'wymeditor' class to the textarea
	* add a 'wymupdate' class to the submit button


Extra info
----------

This plugin uses an svn:external to automatically get the latest version of WYMeditor.
If for some reason the checked out version is not working, you can install a different version like so:

	svn export svn://svn.wymeditor.org/wymeditor/tags/0.4 vendor/plugins/wym_editor_helper/assets/wymeditor

To see what versions are available, check the repository browser at http://files.wymeditor.org/wymeditor/
Keep in mind that if you check out a newer version of WYM, you need to re-run the wym:install rake command to actually copy the wym files to the public dir. If you do so, be sure to first back up your configuration file (/javascripts/boot_wym.js) if you made any changes to it.

For possible configuration options, you can look at the examples provided in /wymeditor/tests (the ones in /wymeditor/examples are not working at this moment).

Also have a look at the WYMeditor trac for more documentation:
