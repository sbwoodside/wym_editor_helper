WymEditorHelper
===============
makes it easy to incorporate WYMeditor into your views. 
Follow these steps to use:

	* ruby script/plugin install svn://zuurstof.openminds.be/home/kaizer/svn/wym_editor_helper
	* rake wym:install
	* Put <%= wym_editor_initialize %> in the view that will host the text editing form.
	Prefereably this goes into your html's HEAD, to keep our html W3C valid. 
	I use <%= wym_editor_initialize unless !%w(new create edit).include?(@controller.action_name) -%> in my layout. 
	This means the editor will only load when someone is creating or editing something.
	* create a database, and a model with ie. a content column.
	* in the form, instead of text_area, use <%= wym_editor :model, :content%>

This plugin uses WYMeditor 0.3, which is still alpha (REV 227 19/04/2007).
When 0.3 hits stable, this plugin will also be updated.

for making Textile Editor Helper, which inspired me to put WYM on Rails.
