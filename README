Makes it easy to incorporate WYMeditor into your views.

About WYM
---------

WYMeditor is a web-based WYSIWYM XHTML editor.

WYMeditor's main concept is to leave details of the document's visual layout, and to concentrate on its structure and meaning, while trying to give the user as much comfort as possible (at least as WYSIWYG editors).

WYMeditor has been created to generate perfectly structured XHTML strict code, to conform to the W3C XHTML specifications and to facilitate further processing by modern applications.

With WYMeditor, the code can't be contaminated by visual informations like font styles and weights, borders, colors, ...
The end-user defines content meaning, which will determine its aspect by the use of style sheets. The result is easy and quick maintenance of information.

As the code is compliant to W3C XHTML specifications, you can for example process it using a XSLT (at the client or the server side), giving you a wide range of applications.

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to use:

	* From your project's root, run:
		ruby script/plugin install svn://zuurstof.openminds.be/home/kaizer/svn/rails_stuff/plugins/wym_editor_helper
		rake wym:install
	* Put <%= wym_editor_initialize %> in the view that will host the text editing form.
	Prefereably this goes into the HEAD section, to keep your html W3C valid. 
	Use <% content_for :head do %> <%= wym_editor_initialize %> <% end %> in the view that needs the editor, and <%= yield :head %> in the layout. This means the editor will only load when it is truly called for.
	(Thanks Steven Soroka over at http://www.clearlinewebsystems.ca/)
	* in the form, instead of i.e. <%= text_area :article, :content %>, use <%= wym_editor :article, :content %>
	OR add a 'wymeditor' class to the textarea
	* add a 'wymupdate' class to the submit button


Extra info
----------

This plugin uses an svn:external to automatically get the latest version of WYMeditor.
If for some reason the checked out version is not working, you can install a different version like so:

	svn export svn://svn.wymeditor.org/wymeditor/tags/0.4 vendor/plugins/wym_editor_helper/assets/wymeditor

To see what versions are available, check the repository browser at http://files.wymeditor.org/wymeditor/
Keep in mind that if you check out a newer version of WYM, you need to re-run the wym:install rake command to actually copy the wym files to the public dir. If you do so, be sure to first back up your configuration file (/javascripts/boot_wym.js) if you made any changes to it.

For possible configuration options, you can look at the examples provided in /wymeditor/tests (the ones in /wymeditor/examples are not working at this moment).

Also have a look at the WYMeditor trac for more documentation:
